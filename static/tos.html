		<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

		<p>
			Usage of any part of the <strong>ChainedLink</strong> website constitutes acceptance of these Terms of Service.
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of <strong>ChainedLink</strong> is to create a public profile for yourself, much like on LinkedIn. Only use <strong>ChainedLink</strong> for that purpose.
		</p>
		<p>
			You must own rights to anything (images, text, etc) you share in your public profile on <strong>ChainedLink</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If it would be appropriate to display on your LinkedIn profile, Facebook profile, Twitter profile, online resume, or G-rated personal blog or internet forum, then it's OK to share via <strong>ChainedLink</strong>. That means <strong>no</strong> pornography, nudity, or otherwise socially unacceptable images or text&mdash;basically <strong>anything not suitable</strong> to share with children&mdash;are allowed.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do not track or verify the owner or identity of any profile, so we make <strong>no guarantees of any sort</strong> as to whether any of the information on a profile is accurate.
		</p>
		<p>
			We make no guarantees of any sort as to the availability of profiles or any information therein.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>ChainedLink</strong> does not store avatar images for profiles, but instead uses <a href="https://gitvatar.io">gitvatar</a>. All avatar images uploaded to gitvatar and shared on <strong>ChainedLink</strong> must also comply with the <a href="https://gitvatar.io/tos">gitvatar Terms of Service</a>. gitvatar uses an email address to uniquely identify each uploaded avatar image, so you must provide one to upload an avatar image.
		</p>
		<p>
			As stated in our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, we do not specifically track any person's usage of this service. However, to ensure that the service remains available for all internet users, we reserve the right to monitor our service for abusive (harmful to the service or others) behavior, and respond accordingly, including blocking the source of the abusive behavior, removing any content that is deemed to violate these <em>Terms of Service</em>, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please <strong>do not abuse</strong> the site with excessive requests. Web scraping is not allowed. There is no formal rate limiting applied at the moment, but abusers will be limited or blocked. If you have a legitimate need that may exceed these limits, please <a href="https://github.com/chained-link/chained.link/issues">contact us</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			As <strong>ChainedLink</strong> stores and serves user-generated content in the form of profile text and avatar images that are publicly accessible, we are expected by various legal authorities around the world to ensure that any content we serve does not violate any applicable laws, including copyrighted material, illegal imagery like child pornography, etc. We are required to respond to any official reports of content in our system violating any of these laws; our response will be to immediately and permanently blacklist the content in question, meaning it will no longer display in any part of this website.
		</p>
		<p>
			We ultimately reserve the right to permanently blacklist any profile information from our system, at our discretion, if we find it violates any part of these <em>Terms of Service</em>.
