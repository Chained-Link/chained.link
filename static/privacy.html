		<h1>Privacy</h1>

		<p>
			<strong>ChainedLink</strong> creates public profiles on the <a href="http://mentocoin.com">MentoCoin Blockchain</a>. You decide how much you share or don't share. As such, you're entirely in control of your own privacy of that information. If you share something, it will become part of a permanent public record.
		</p>
		<p>
			We don't track you in any way, except as minimally necessary to facilitate you creating and sharing your profile information on the Blockchain.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>ChainedLink</strong> uses <a href="http://gitvatar.io">gitvatar</a> for profile avatar images; gitvatar uses an email address to uniquely identify each uploaded avatar image. If you choose to link an avatar image to your <strong>ChainedLink</strong> profile, you must provide an email address for the upload. Neither gitvatar nor <strong>ChainedLink</strong> store that upload's email address in a usable way&mdash;only stored as a hash&mdash; nor will we ever use it to contact you, or share it with anyone else.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> We're not specifically aware of, nor in control of, the privacy or tracking policies, or Terms of Service, for <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> (where some profile data/information are ultimately stored). Please contact Github for additional information.
